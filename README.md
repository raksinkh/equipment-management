## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 18, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Real-time)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Deployment**: Vercel (recommended)

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Supabase account (free tier available)
- Resend account for email notifications (optional)
- LINE Notify token for push notifications (optional)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd equipment-management
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Supabase

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. Get your project URL and anon key from Settings > API
3. Copy `env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your Supabase credentials:

```bash
cp env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here
LINE_NOTIFY_TOKEN=your_line_notify_token_here
```

### 3. Set Up Database

1. Go to your Supabase project SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the contents of `database-schema.sql`
3. Run the SQL script to create all tables and policies

### 4. Create Manager User

1. Go to Authentication > Users in Supabase
2. Create a new user with email `manager@example.com`
3. Go to SQL Editor and run:
```sql
UPDATE public.users SET role = 'manager' WHERE email = 'manager@example.com';
```

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Tables

- **users**: User profiles and roles
- **equipment**: Equipment inventory and status
- **bookings**: Equipment booking requests and approvals
- **notifications**: System notifications and alerts

### Key Relationships

- Users can have multiple bookings
- Equipment can have multiple bookings (over time)
- Bookings link users to equipment with date ranges
- Notifications are linked to specific users

## üîê Authentication & Security

- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Database-level access control
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure authentication with Supabase Auth
- **Role-based Access**: Different permissions for users vs managers
- **Secure API Routes**: Protected endpoints with proper validation

## üìß Email & LINE Notifications

### Email Setup (Resend)
1. Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Get your API key
3. Add to `.env.local`

### LINE Notifications
1. Go to [notify-bot.line.me](https://notify-bot.line.me)
2. Create a new LINE Notify service
3. Get your token and add to `.env.local`

## üöÄ Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy automatically on every push

### Other Platforms

The app can be deployed to any platform that supports Next.js:
- Netlify
- Railway
- DigitalOcean App Platform
- AWS Amplify
